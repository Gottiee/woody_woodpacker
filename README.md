# woody_woodpacker

The goal of this project is to code a program that will at first encrypt a program given as parameter. Only 64 bits ELF files will be managed here.

A new program called woody will be generated from this execution. When this new program (woody) will be executed, it will have to be decrypted to be run. Its execution has to be totally identical to the program given as parameter in the last step.

## Usage

```bash
./woody_woodpacker [elf64bit]
# IF no arg provide it is looking for 'a.out'
```
